# Enterprise Application Develop Lab 1 - Bootstrap Template
In the first lab you will have to reuse code downloaded from Bootstrap.
For this lab, you will need to have a bit of imagination and create a website on something
you like, and that other people will unlikely have a similar website.
- You could do a website on any specific topic such as cactus; hedgehogs; Elvis Presley;
a small town like Alquezar, Huesca (Spain); your favourite soccer player or group band;
a famous writer, movie director, or painter; or any other person/topic that catches your
eye.
- Avoid making a website of yourself or an imaginary company since that was last year
topic.
- Better to pick topics with which most people would be comfortable.
- Since this is not going to be published, you do not need to create the content and you
can use any content on the web instead. However, it is important to add references to
the pictures/texts you are using in your website.
